This is a companion repo for the blog https://darrenwhite.dev/blog/custom-ui-amplify-nextjs where I create a custom authentication UI with the AWS amplify auth class.

I have update this to Next 14.x and NextAuth 4

There are quite a lot of changes to NextAuth since that original repo

Also updated and fixed a log of dependencies that were causing build failures

Principles are all pretty much the same - just some object type changes and syntax

The NextAuth upgrade changes are mostly covered here
